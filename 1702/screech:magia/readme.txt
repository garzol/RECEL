I got 3 eproms from Paulo Gordinho.

The 3 were dedicated to screech/magia variant.

Paulo identified its eproms with colour post-its (red, violet, yellow)

I built a home made 1702 reader and tried each eprom twice. Hence 6 files (2 per colour)

The 6 files are identical, proving that we successfully read the eprom.


Caution: I did my best to fetch data in right address order (from 0 to 255, 0 being 0V, 1 being 5V)
And in correct logic for data (0 being 0V, 1 being 5V)

Nevertheless, it is quite a pain in the back to ensure a correct polarity all across the acquisition chain...

Moreover, there was no means to verify against a reference, since there was no reference available.

Therefore, maybe the data must be inverted in one or the other way. But normally it is ok.

The 256 bits are pure configuration, then it is impossible to check the contents since its can be anything.
